## ‚ùì Problem Statement

The current information sharing ecosystem at MGIT faces several challenges:

1. **Fragmented Information Sources**: Academic and technical content is scattered across multiple platforms, making it difficult for students to access relevant information
2. **Limited Campus-Specific Content**: Existing blogging platforms lack focus on MGIT-specific topics, events, and academic discussions
3. **Reduced Student Engagement**: Absence of a dedicated platform results in missed opportunities for meaningful student interaction and collaboration
4. **Lack of Structured Knowledge Repository**: No centralized system exists to preserve and organize valuable insights from students and faculty
5. **Inadequate Content Moderation**: External platforms don't provide institution-specific content guidelines and moderation
